# CS250 Module 8 Journal


    How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
    - User needs are something that the team needs to envision and enact so that the product is already formed when the actual work begins, and the team just has to add code to it to get that vision to work. By creating user stories, changes and progress is noted, so that the project can accomodate changes and know if the progress being made is satisfactory.
    How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
    - The approach to developing programs is to lay out how the program is going to be written and function, so there is some flow in it. It will be helpful to incorporate user stories and product backlog into my future development work, cause it does help in helping to streamline the workflow.
    What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
    - To be a good team member is to update others on your work done and pending, so that others can work around it.
